# Implementation Notes

`react-true-resizable` is a React components that is written with modern React techniques and uses modern web API.

### what Resizable actually do

`react-true-resizable` does not mutate the style of the target DOM node except for the `width` and `height` properties
(in order to make the node resizable), and `box-sizing` property is set to `border-box` (in order to place the handles correctly).

the `position` property does not being mutated, and no DOM node is created and wrapped around the target node therefore the layout
of the target DOM node will not be affected.

### how handles are placed
the handles wanted position is calculated using [getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) in
with respect to the target DOM node, and placing them relative to their absolute positioned parent which will
be injected as a children of the target DOM node using ReactPortal, this way can create Resizable solution that works
independently of the target DOM node position style!

### what other libs do
other resizable solutions are setting the `position` property to `relative` or `absolute` in order to place the handles correctly,
which make their behavior be inconsistent between different positioning style.
